This is a repository for a class project in reinforcement learning.

### Run the file RL_testbed_draft.py from the same directory as the following: 
1. All_Samples_001 (data folder)
2. Sample_A (data folder)
3. PercolationThresholds.txt (data file)

Creates a folder for results (pickled dictionary) and figs based on a trial number. The trial number is also taken as the random seed.

### Kind of working but not correct:
1. Episodic semigradient SARSA (Sutton and Barto, pg. 244) - with linear approximation function 

### To do:
2. Episodic semigradient SARSA (Sutton and Barto, pg. 244) - with neural approximation function
3. Continuous semigradient SARSA (Sutton and Barto, pg. 244) - with linear approximation function
4. Continuous semigradient SARSA (Sutton and Barto, pg. 244) - with neural approximation function
